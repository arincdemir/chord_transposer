# chord_transposer
A program to quickly give out all the transposes of a song's chords.

- Copy the chords with the lyrics from a website.
- Paste it to the text file.
- Run the program.
- A new text file with the transposes should appear.

* For now the program crashes if a chord appears several times in a line(a row). You might want to split the line so that there is no multiple instance of a chord before running the program.
